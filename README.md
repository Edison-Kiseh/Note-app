# Note-app

Ohh I loved making this one as well. It is a note web application that i made using angular. It is similar to the OneNote app. During my second semester in the second year, all I had to do was to create the gui and a local json db. Basically the user can create and write to as many notes as they can and then group these notes using a notebook.

They both can be deleted on demand, and restored from the recycle bin if needed.
