# Note-app

Ohh I loved making this one as well. It is a note web application that i made using angular, during my second in the second year. It is similar to the OneNote app. All I had to do was to create the gui and a local json db. Basically the user can create and write to as many notes as they can and then group these notes using a notebook. These notes can be deleted on demand and then restored from the recycle bin if needed.
